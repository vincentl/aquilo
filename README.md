# Aquilo

A project for representing recipes as Directed Acyclic Graphs

# Introduction

A recipe describes how to start with a set of ingredients and apply a sequence of operations to arrive at a final product. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a mathematical concept with nodes and directed edges that connect nodes. This project aims to create a specification of nodes and edges to enable concise representation of a recipe as a DAG.

For example, a recipe for whipped cream is represented by the DAG:

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'base',
    'themeVariables': {
      'fontFamily': 'monospace'
    }
  }
}%%

  W{"Whip

  T[Whipped Cream]

# Ingredients and Recipe Steps as Nodes with Properties

A DAG is an abstract concept defined in terms of graph nodes and directed edges. Defining additional structure on a DAG brings the abstract definition into the domain of food recipes. Four node types, each having a list of required and optional properities, enable representing both recipes and hints for formating the recipe for visual display:
- Ingredient Nodes
- Operation Nodes
- Final Proudct Nodes
- Grouping Nodes

The following subsections describe each node type and associated properties. A property is a key/value pair used to systematically encode important aspects of the node. For example, every node must have a **uuid** property key with a [RFC4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122) Universally Unique IDentifier value and the node may have a **css** property key with a string value encoding a Cascading Style Sheet declarations for formating the node. The uuid is only used to identify the node in a single recipe, so the same ingredient in two different recipes will have different uuid values.

A node also has **ports** to indicate what flows in and out. An ingredient node will typically have a single **output** port. Operation nodes will have one or more intial **input** ports and usually one **output** port. For operations that require inputs during the operations, such as slowly streaming the ingredient in over time, will have a **during** port. The port name **uno** is used when a port list has a single entry.

In the following sections,
- a **bold** property key indicates it is required
- a normal text property key is optional
- a _italic_ property value indicates it is an example of the value and will likely be different in an actual recipe DAG
- a normal text property value is the specific value for the node type

## Ingredients as Source Nodes

There are four ingredients in the whipped cream example in the introduction. The ingredients are presented as a single **group** node to improve readability. An ingredient node represents a single item and has the following properties
- **type**: source
- **uuid**: _4B049226-5437-4724-B5F1-2336938850AE_
- **name**: _heavy cream_
- **unit**: _gram_
- **quantity**: _360_
- **output**: [_uno_]
- css: _null_
- description: _cold_
- upc: _742365-216855_
- ean: _0-742365-216855_
- e-number: _E100_

## Operations as Internal Nodes

Combine and Whip are two operations in the whipped cream example. Combine simple means to group the ingredients together into a common vessel, but Whip requires a termination condition. Terminate conditions describe when the operation is complete. Part of this specification is a reigstry of available operations and termination conditions. The registry will grow over time to accomodate recipes that cannot be accurately represented using the available operations.

An operation node has the following properties
- **type**: operation
- **uuid**: _32DB627B-F311-4FC7-998F-86F382E08F98_
- **name**: _whip_
- **input**: [_5DB4DF97-7096-4002-90D3-1E5BE421898F.uno_]
- **during**: []
- **output**: [_uno_]
- **terminate**: [_when.thick_]
- css: _null_
- description: _vigourously_
