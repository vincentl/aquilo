# Aquilo

A project for representing recipes as Directed Acyclic Graphs

# Introduction

A recipe describes how to start with a set of ingredients and apply a sequence of operations to arrive at a final product. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a mathematical concept with nodes and directed edges that connect nodes. This project aims to create a specification of nodes and edges to enable concise representation of a recipe as a DAG.

# Ingredients and Recipe Steps as Nodes

## Node metadata

## Ingredients as Source Nodes

## Operations as Internal Nodes

## Final Products as Sink Nodes
